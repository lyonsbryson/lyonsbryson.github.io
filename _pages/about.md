Hello! I am a PhD student at Florida State University. My research interests are broadly American political institutions, with particular interest in Majority/Minority dynamics, congressional messaging, and judicial efficacy. 
Outside of the academy, I spent time as a high school football coach, enjoy college football and baseball, and am an avid Redsox fan.
