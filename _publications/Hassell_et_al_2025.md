Increased in-group affinity and outgroup hostility between Democrats and Republicans, or 
affective polarization, has been highlighted as a major problem in the current political 
environment. Recent literature suggests that political anger drives increased affective 
polarization and scholars have even found that political anger may influence social polarization 
in non-political settings. Our research seeks to build upon this existing literature by proposing 
that anger elicited from an apolitical source can also lead to increased affective polarization. To 
test our hypotheses, we conducted two survey experiments that measured the effects of anger 
elicited from political and apolitical sources and its effects on affective polarization. We found 
that anger elicited from both political and apolitical settings leads to greater affective 
polarization. In short, anger prompts greater in-group affinity and outgroup hostility in politics 
regardless of whether the anger originates in politics. Our findings are important because they 
suggest that anger is a key contributor to increased affective polarization and that reducing anger 
in society may slow the rapid rise of affective polarization.
